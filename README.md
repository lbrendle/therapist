# therapist
Created using SwiftUI in a style like Tinder.

Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our therapist-matching app! This app allows users to swipe left or right on therapists, just like on popular dating apps. It is built using Swift and SwiftUI for iOS, and uses Firebase as the database.

Features

User profiles: each user can create and customize their own profile.
Therapist profiles: therapists can create their own profiles and list their qualifications, specialties, and other information.
Swipeable and scrollable cards: users can swipe left or right on therapist cards to indicate their preference, and can scroll through the cards to view multiple therapists at once.
Matching: when a user and a therapist both swipe right on each other, they are considered a match and can communicate with each other through the app.
In-app messaging: users and therapists can send and receive messages within the app.
