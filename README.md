# therapist
Created using SwiftUI in a style like Tinder.


I am in the process of building an app like Tinder that allows users to swipe left or right on therapists.

The app is built in Swift and SwiftUI for iOS.

Some of the features include a user profile, therapist profile, swipable and scrollable cards for the therapists, and the ability to match with a therapist. 

Features to be built include in-app messaging.

The app uses Firebase as the database.
